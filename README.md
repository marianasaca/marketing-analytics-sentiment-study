# 📊 Marketing Analytics: Sentiment-Driven Product Strategy
**Author:** Mariana Saca  
**Context:** Master in Business Analytics & Data Science, IE University

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project bridges the gap between **Brand Strategy** and **Technical Analytics**. Using a dataset of 23,000+ e-commerce reviews, I utilized **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to identify "Hidden Risk" products—items that maintain high star ratings but contain negative underlying sentiment in the text.

## 💡 Key Strategic Findings
* **The "Rating Gap":** Identified a significant cluster of 5-star products with negative VADER sentiment scores, indicating latent customer dissatisfaction.
* **Topic Modeling (LDA):** Uncovered that negative sentiment in high-rated items is primarily driven by **fit inconsistencies** (specifically "petite" scaling and "tight" upper-body fits).
* **Business Recommendation:** Recommended the implementation of "Runs Small" badges for identified Clothing IDs to manage expectations and reduce return rates.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **NLP:** NLTK (VADER Sentiment Analysis)
* **Modeling:** Scikit-Learn (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
